# Memorize

> ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS

Memorize is a memory game written in Swift.
You can follow along and create your own version of it if you go to this [link](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/2021-0)

My version of Memorize is written using the VisionOS SDK! Users of this version
can load up the game on their Apple Vision headset and play it
